I don't have our 2025 paper and I wrote it a couple months back so take this with a grain of salt:
Ton of theory on everything, you really had to know the concepts in depth 

Gave us a big diagram of a full RNN architecture (or something else I forget but it was a big diagram from the slides) and you had to fill in the missing components names / explain the different parts.

Asked us to compute a transformer calc but it was a huge matrix, like 3x3 attention matrix which tripped up a lot of people

He asked us about afribert, their discoveries / key stuff etc.
